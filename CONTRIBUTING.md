# Contributing
Contributing is pretty simple, and takes place entirely through pull requests.

## Contribution Guidelines
There aren't any real guidelines to follow, just PR what you believe would be a handy addition or would fix/otherwise resolve any issues in the software. Keep your code relatively clean and ensure it works before opening a pull request (or, alternatively, mark it as a `draft`).

I do not expect any certain criteria to be met, don't be afraid to PR if you feel like it.
